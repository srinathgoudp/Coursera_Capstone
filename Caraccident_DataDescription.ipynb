These features include:\nSDOTCOLNUM, Coordinates, LOCATION, INCDTTM, INCDATE, REPORTNO, COLDETKEY, INCKEY, OBJECTID.<br>\n\nThere are some description columns for a given code. Columns ST_COLDESC, SDOT_COLDESC and EXCEPTRSNDESC are description columns for \ncode which is already specified in the given dataset.<br>\n\nThere are also data columns which has missing data in abundance. Column EXCEPTRSNCODE, EXCEPTRSNDESC, PEDROWNOTGRNT, SPEEDING, \nINATTENTIONIND and INTKEY have more than 50% of data missing. Although few of these columns can be very crucial indicator of collision \nseverity, it would be misguiding to use it with so many missing rows and very difficult to fill in these categorical values.<br>\n\nColumns mentioned in all the three categories above will not be used in the model that we are going to build.
